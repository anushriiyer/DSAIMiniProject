Group Members: Anushri Iyer, Sreeja Tar, Joel Tan

## Dataset


**Source:** [Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2020-nsduh-2020-ds0001)

The source provides statistical information on the abuse and dependence of illicit drugs and substances in the US along with relevant categories such as demographics, income and mental health.


## Motivation 
Substance abuse—involving drugs, alcohol have long led to concerning social conditions such as familial and financial problems, loss of productivity, domestic violence, child abuse, and crime. Social attitudes and legal responses to the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs make substance abuse one of the most complex public health issues.

Another rising concern in the US is Mental Health. It is #3 in the World Mental Health Ranking[(Source)](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-09-14/the-10-most-depressed-countries). 

In fact, according to statistics [(Source)](https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/learn/index.htm):

- 1 in 5 Americans will experience a mental illness in a given year 
- 1 in 5 children, either currently or at some point during their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental illness. 

With this in mind, our group started considering the relationship between mental health and substance abuse while questioning what are some variables that could potentially affect an issue as grave as substance abuse. We believe that identifying certain variables that could help predict the subsceptibility to drug/substance abuse is useful for different stakeholders such as the government, non-profit organisations and the local community. This can inspire government programmes, awareness campaigns and reliefs for the identified group that is most likely to abuse different types of substances.

**Main Question**: _How do different variables affect one’s susceptibility to substance abuse?_
